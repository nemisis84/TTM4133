Inside the Request, you can find information like the aggregate maximum bit rate for UL and DL, new GUTI assigned by the MME and other QoS parameters. Following that, the eNodeB sends the Response message to the MME as acknowledge, including the TEID (Tunnel Endpoint Identity, id used for the tunnel between Serving-GW and UE, i.e. E-RAB) of the eNodeB and the address of the eNodeB;\n",
