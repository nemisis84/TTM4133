    "\n",
    "This lab intends to explore the LTE architecture and the attachment procedure for a user equipment (UE). The lab starts with an introduction of the LTE architecture followed by the attachment process itself encompassing different connection stages as UE initiates its connection with the LTE network. Afterwards, a simulation encompassing different connection establishment and attachment processes is implemented using ns-3 LTE simulator. The students will be encouraged to design their own LTE radio access network (RAN) topologies using React app discussed in detail in Lab0. A summary of the lab objectives is provided as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the RAN, EPC, and, interconnections between these LTE sub-networks\n",

The S1 interface is the connection between the RAN and EPC utilized for the LTE services such as traditional calling, voice over IP (VoIP) and dedicated data access towards the internet. It has two different interface types based on utilization by the user plane and control plane protocols. S1-U is used for user plane and S1-AP for the application or control plane. In addition any signaling between RAN and EPC is also carried via S1. EPC has its own interfaces for performing different management functions related to the LTE processes such as mobility and location management or user information management.<br>\n",

The process starts with the communication between UEs and eNBs as the cell search begins with the attachment of users to eNBs. This is followed up by random access and the associated states of the UEs and eNBs upon reception of various communication messages from within RAN and the EPC. The state machine implementation in ns-3 for the eNB and UE RRC layers allows the users in the LTE RAN to transition through these states upon occurrence of various events. By observing the sequence of events, we can verify, optimize and potentially troubleshoot issues in the network."

    "The UE and eNB serve different roles in the network, the eNB should ensure that UEs in its range has a connection to it, so it should have a higher txpower value than the UE to provide coverage for a large area for multiple UEs, which is important to ensure good coverage at the edge of the coverage cell/area. \n",
    "The UE has to conserve power because it uses a battery with limited power. \n",

An example of this is that two UEs close to each other with high txpower will result in interference and affect the performance of the whole network. \n",
